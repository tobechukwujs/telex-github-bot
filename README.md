GitHub Issue Manager (Telex AI Agent)This is a smart AI agent built for the Telex.im AI Agent Hackathon. It integrates directly with your Telex chat workspace and allows your team to manage GitHub issues without ever leaving the conversation.This project is built with JavaScript in the standard Mastra project structure (src/mastra/index.js) to ensure it can be correctly imported and deployed on the Mastra platform.🚀 The ProblemIn a fast-paced development team, switching contexts between your chat application (like Telex) and project management tools (like GitHub) is a constant drain on productivity. Simple tasks like checking open bugs or reporting a new one require you to stop, open a new tab, navigate to the correct repository, and fill out a form.💡 The SolutionThe GitHub Issue Manager bot solves this by bringing GitHub's core functionality directly into your Telex chat. It acts as an interactive utility that can:Fetch and display a list of open issues from your project's repository.Instantly create a new, well-formed issue (with a title and body) on GitHub.✨ FeaturesList Open Issues: Get a quick overview of the 5 most recent open issues.Create New Issues: Report a bug or add a new task right as you're discussing it.Mastra-Native: Built with the src/mastra/index.js file structure required for deployment.Locally Testable: Run npm run dev to test the bot on your local machine.Secure: Uses a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) stored as an environment variable.🛠️ How It WorksThis project is built to be recognized by the Mastra deployment platform.Mastra imports the project and identifies the src/mastra/index.js entrypoint.When a user in Telex types a command (e.g., /@agent gh issues), Telex.im sends a payload to the Mastra-hosted agent.The agent logic in src/mastra/agents/github.agent.js is triggered.The agent parses the command and calls the appropriate function in src/mastra/tools/github.tool.js.The tool uses the official GitHub REST API (via axios) to perform the action.A formatted text response is sent back to Telex.Tech StackRuntime: Node.jsAPI: GitHub REST APIHTTP Client: AxiosEnvironment: dotenvCOMMANDS1.
