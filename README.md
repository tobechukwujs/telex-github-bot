GitHub Issue Manager (Telex AI Agent)This is a smart AI agent built for the Telex.im AI Agent Hackathon. It integrates directly with your Telex chat workspace and allows your team to manage GitHub issues without ever leaving the conversation.This project is built with a scalable Node.js structure, separating concerns into services, controllers, and routes.🚀 The ProblemIn a fast-paced development team, switching contexts between your chat application (like Telex) and project management tools (like GitHub) is a constant drain on productivity. Simple tasks like checking open bugs or reporting a new one require you to stop, open a new tab, navigate to the correct repository, and fill out a form.💡 The SolutionThe GitHub Issue Manager bot solves this by bringing GitHub's core functionality directly into your Telex chat. It acts as an interactive utility that can:Fetch and display a list of open issues from your project's repository.Instantly create a new, well-formed issue (with a title and body) on GitHub.✨ FeaturesList Open Issues: Get a quick overview of the 5 most recent open issues.Create New Issues: Report a bug or add a new task right as you're discussing it.Interactive: The bot responds to your specific commands in real-time.Secure: Uses a GitHub Personal AccessToken (PAT) stored securely on the server.Well-Structured: Code is organized by feature (services, controllers, routes) for maintainability.🛠️ How It WorksThe agent is a Node.js (Express) server that acts as a webhook.A user in Telex types a command (e.g., /@agent gh issues).Telex.im sends a JSON payload to this agent's live API endpoint (/api/telex).The server's telex.routes.js file routes the request to the telex.controller.js.The controller parses the command and calls the appropriate function in github.service.js.The service uses the official GitHub REST API (via axios) to perform the action.The service returns a formatted response, which the controller sends back to Telex.Tech StackBackend: Node.js, Express.jsAPI: GitHub REST APIHTTP Client: AxiosEnvironment: dotenv for managing API keysCOMMANDS1.
